# Graphics Rendering Techniques

This CS4247 module, taken at NUS Singapore, provided a general treatment of real-time and offline rendering techniques in 3D computer graphics. Specific topics included the raster graphics pipeline, viewing and transformation, real-time mapping techniques, real-time shadow algorithms, local reflection models, global illumination, distributed ray tracing, photon mapping, radiosity, volume rendering, image-based rendering and modelling, and strategies for anti-aliasing and photo-realism. 


## Assignment 1: OpenGL reflections and texturing

I completed an OpenGL program to simulate planar reflection using texture-mapping and a multipass rendering technique.

## Assignment 2: Whitted Ray Tracing Algorithm

I completed an OpenGL program that implements Whitted Ray Tracing. It computes ray intersections, lighting computations and handles shadow and secondary rays recursively.

## Assignment 3: Progressive Refinement Radiosity Algorithm

I completed an OpenGL program that implements the Progressive REfinement Radiosity Algorithm using Hemicubes to estimate form factors.
